# Linked List Implementation
## Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node and  Create a Linked List class that have head property  and contain some of methods "insert" ,"includes","to string"

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
 ### Linked list
 ### space complexity :O(n) 
 ### time complexity:O(n) 
## Solution
 ### python linked_list.py
 ### pytest
